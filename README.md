# Graduate-Test-Engineer-Technical-Exercise

Please review all sections of the assessment below and complete all questions within each section. The take home should take you no longer than 3 hours to complete. If you have issues or questions arise while reviewing, please reach out to me. 

Along with this take home, we’ll be scheduling a technical interview. We ask that you submit a copy of your answers at least one day in advance of that interview.

Thank you in advance for taking the time to complete this!


## Part 1 - Test Planning & Design
Write a 1-page test plan for this project and at least 5 test scenarios that should be executed for this initiative. Please spend no longer than 1 hour on this exercise section — we’re looking for a concise 1-pager and will spend the rest of the time talking through it live. 

*Scenario:* Amazon has just added the option to refine searches by Product Categories.

*Assume the following:*

•	The filter will return products that are in the category selected

•	It is supported in both web and mobile-web view


## Part 2 - Automation
The purpose of this exercise is to evaluate your approach in designing automated test cases. You can show us how you approach automation scope, setup, tear downs, assertions, and shared methods. Please spend no longer than 2 hours on this exercise section — we will spend the rest of the time talking through it live. 

Using the same requirements specified in the Test Planning and Design exercise, write a Cypress test that will:

•	Validate the happy path of using a product category filter and the system returning valid results.

*Assume the following:*

•	No log-in is needed

•	Elements/locators can be named any way you want.
